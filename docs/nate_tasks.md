1. Movement
- based on a persons filed of view I should find the next best spot to move to
- they can remain stationary if they are in a good spot
- they can move somewhere random if they dont know where to go
- they can remember where they have been and what was back there
2. Combat
- based on two peoples strength and strategy the normal form game will be modified
- the winner will get the space they were fighting over the loser will stay in the same spot
